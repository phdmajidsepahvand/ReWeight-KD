# Reweighting Ensemble Distillation for Domain-Generalized Medical Diagnosis



This project implements:

* Teacher ensemble (3 networks)
* Student network distilled using:

  * Dirichlet-based sample reweighting
  * KL-divergence distillation
  * Cross entropy supervision



## Train teachers:

python train\_teachers.py --train\_path Train student:

python train\_student.py --train\_path
